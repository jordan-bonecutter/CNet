# CNet
A simple ANN written in ANSI C. Not practical, but fun.

The main goal of this project was to prove to myself that I understood how ANNs work. Maybe it can help you too!
I heavily referenced 3Blue1Brown's series on Neural Networks. This is evident in the Matrix / Vector multiplication 
respresentation of my NN. I have trained it on MNIST with roughly 90% accuracy.
